### Chinese Zodiac Animals

This Chinese Zodiac Animals project is an educational interface where divs for each of the 12 animals of the Chinese Zodiac are made in the DOM dynamically, using JavaScript. 
- The code loops an array of 12 animal objects, and makes a div for each one. Inside each div go several elements, including images and text.
- There is a sound icon which when clicked plays the pronununciation of the animal in both English and Chinese. 
- There is also an input box to enter either the English or Chinese Pinyin (Romanization) version of the name.
